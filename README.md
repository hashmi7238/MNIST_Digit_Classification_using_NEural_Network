**MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using Neural Network**


This project is focused on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a deep learning model. The dataset consists of 70,000 images of digits (0-9), where the model is trained to recognize and classify these digits with high accuracy.


**Project Overview**


Model Type: Deep Neural Network (DNN)

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset

Accuracy: 97.1%


**Key Features**


Data Preprocessing: The MNIST dataset is loaded, and the images are normalized for better training performance.

Model Architecture: A fully connected multi-layer neural network is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the training set (60,000 images) and evaluated on the test set (10,000 images), achieving a classification accuracy of 97.1%.

Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is generated to evaluate the classification results across all digit classes.


**Libraries and Tools Used**


Python: Core programming language

NumPy: Numerical operations

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization of results

TensorFlow/Keras: Neural network implementation

scikit-learn: Data splitting, model evaluation


**Model Performance**


Accuracy: 97.1%

Confusion Matrix: A detailed confusion matrix was generated to visualize and analyze classification accuracy across all digit classes.


**Future Enhancements**
